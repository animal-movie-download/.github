## The Story of *Animal*

The film explores the complex dynamics between Ranbir Kapoor’s character, Ranvijay Singh, and his father, Balbir Singh, played by Anil Kapoor. Ranvijay adores his father but feels neglected due to Balbir’s dedication to building his billion-dollar business.

Ranvijay grows up with unresolved resentment, developing an aggressive and unpredictable personality. He believes his wealth entitles him to act however he pleases, while Balbir struggles to reconcile with his son's increasingly criminal tendencies.

The tension escalates as their relationship reaches a breaking point, setting the stage for a dramatic and action-packed journey filled with raw emotions and violent confrontations.

## Director Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s Vision

Sandeep Reddy Vanga, known for his blockbuster *Kabir Singh*, brings his signature intensity to *Animal*. His films are character-driven, focusing on extreme emotions and unpredictable reactions. With *Animal*, Vanga delivers another high-octane drama where emotions, action, and music blend seamlessly.

However, critics have noted that Ranvijay’s character often feels like an extension of Kabir Singh, with similar traits of impulsiveness, aggression, and passion. Despite this, the film’s gripping action scenes, particularly an 18-minute sequence before the interval, keep viewers on the edge of their seats.
